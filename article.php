A Request for Proposal (RFP) for the additional servers was sent to 6 companies, including Huawei and the existing incumbent. Based on their responses a list of 3 potential 
solutions was selected. This was the point when Huawei started to stand out as a serious contender.
Huawei’s response to RFP was impressive. It had clearly done its homework and demonstrated a deep understanding 
of what we were doing with Hadoop. Not only were all the answers given very relevant, alternative suggestions were made for the server’s power supply which clearly showed that its people fully understood how a Hadoop cluster runs.
 The solution offered by Huawei was based on its Fusion Server, a new generation 2U dual-socket rack-mounted server. 
 It provides flexible resource expansion capabilities as well as high computing performance and is an ideal choice for internet, big data, and cloud computing and key enterprise applications.
